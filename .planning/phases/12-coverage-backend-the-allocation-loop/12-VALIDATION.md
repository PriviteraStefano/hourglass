# Phase 12 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | go test (testify, testcontainers) |
| **Config file** | none — Go standard |
| **Quick run command** | `go test ./internal/core/services/...` |
| **Full suite command** | `make test` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~60 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `go test ./internal/core/services/...`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `make test`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 60 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 12-01-01 | 01 | 1 | COV-XX | T-12-01 / — | N/A | unit | `go test ./internal/core/services/...` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `internal/core/services/coverage/*_test.go` — stubs for COV-01..05
- [ ] testcontainers Postgres fixture — shared setup

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Period-close snapshot never changes retroactively after report publish | COV-04 | audit replay semantics | Generate close, re-open report, confirm identical rows |

*If none: "All phase behaviors have automated verification."*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 60s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
